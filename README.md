assuming you have cuda set up correctly (about 5 hours of work)

1) `mkdir data`

2) dump everything from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d2zrNIDKd9wWLMR1_U-QRK8XIpL7oUEZ?usp=sharing into data

3) Run `make run` (warning may contain windowisms)

note: I wasn't able to get cmake working on vscode so I gave up and stuck with classic make builds

output to test against is `data\T_S04923_a_c.bin`
